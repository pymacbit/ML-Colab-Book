## **Support Vector Machine**

- Support vector machine is another simple algorithm that every machine learning expert should have in his/her arsenal.

- Support vector machine is highly preferred by many as it produces significant accuracy with less computation power. 

- Support Vector Machine, abbreviated as SVM can be used for both regression and classification tasks. But, it is widely used in classification objectives.

- The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(N — the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.

- To separate the two classes of data points, there are many possible hyperplanes that could be chosen as shown in figure below.

- Our objective is to find a plane that has the maximum margin, i.e the maximum distance between data points of both classes. 

- Maximizing the margin distance provides some reinforcement so that future data points can be classified with more confidence.
