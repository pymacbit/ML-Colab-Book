# **Supervised Learning**

- This algorithm consist of a target / outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables). Using these set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.

- Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn the mapping function that turns input variables (X) into the output variable (Y). In other words, it solves for f in the following equation:

             Y = f (X)

This allows us to accurately generate outputs when given new inputs.

We’ll talk about two types of supervised learning: classification and regression.

### **Regression** 

- it is used to predict the outcome of a given sample when the output variable is in the form of real values. For example, a regression model might process input data to predict the amount of rainfall, the height of a person, etc.

### **Classification** 

- It is used to predict the outcome of a given sample when the output variable is in the form of categories. A classification model might look at the input data and try to predict labels like “sick” or “healthy.”
